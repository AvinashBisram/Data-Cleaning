Data Cleaning Projects
======================

This repository will contain projects related to data cleaning using Python and SQL.

**Language(s):** Python, SQL  
**Package(s):** (Python) Pandas, Seaborn  
**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks  

Projects Coming Soon:
---------------------
This repository will attempt to complete the same overarching task using two programming languages:  
Python (Pandas package) and SQL.

Overarching Task: 
* A fitness coach has one year's worth of client nutrition data containing daily calorie consumption, body weight, macronutrient consumption, nutrition adherence, and more. They eventually want to create a "Nutrition Year in Review" visualization dashboard using this data.
* To accomplish this, we will need to first CLEAN the data (identify duplicates, handle missing data, resolve formatting inconsistencies, and recast column datatypes if necessary).
* Then, the coach wants to create visualizations on columns that do not exist yet but can be created with the supplied data. To do this, we will need to perform FEATURE ENGINEERING to create the final data set that will be adequate for visualization.
