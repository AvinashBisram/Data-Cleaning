Pandas 2021 Nutrition Data Cleaning
===================================

**Description:** This project prepares sample 2021 Nutrition data for future visualization through extensive data cleaning and feature engineering. Missing and duplicate data was handled, column data types were recasted, and 11 new columns were created based on existing data adhereing to pre-defined specifications.

**Language(s):** Python  
**Package(s):** Pandas, Seaborn  
**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks  

**Motivation:** This project was created to demonstrate skills in Python data cleaning and feature engineering simulating a real job scenario. Project goals were outlined beforehand so some tasks required further research into package documentation and creative problem solving. Thus, I was able to become more comfortable with Pandas and the entire of process of data cleaning.

**Note:** This project is still being updated.
