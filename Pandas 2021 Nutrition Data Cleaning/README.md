Pandas 2021 Nutrition Data Cleaning
===================================

**Description:** This project prepares sample 2021 Nutrition data for future visualization through extensive data cleaning and feature engineering. Missing and duplicate data was handled, column data types were recasted, and 11 new columns were created based on existing data adhering to pre-defined specifications.

**Language(s):** Python  
**Package(s):** Pandas, Seaborn  
**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks  

**Motivation:** This project was created to demonstrate skills in Python data cleaning and feature engineering simulating a real job scenario. Project goals were outlined beforehand so some tasks required further research into package documentation and creative problem solving. Thus, I was able to become more comfortable with Pandas and the entire of process of data cleaning.

**Note:** This project is still being updated.

Viewing the Project:
--------------------
The main file for this project is located in the root of this repository named _[Python Nutrition Data Cleaning.ipynb](Python%20Nutrition%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)_. If you have **Jupyter Notebooks** installed, you can download the .ipynb file and view it there. If not, you can view the project using Google Colaboratory [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AvinashBisram/Data-Cleaning/blob/master/Pandas%202021%20Nutrition%20Data%20Cleaning/Python%20Nutrition%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb).  
**Note:** Executing all cells in the main project file will create 2 CSV files on your computer.

About the Data:
---------------
The raw data used for this project was a Microsoft Excel file which tracked daily bodyweight and nutrition information in 2021. A snippet of that data can be seen here:
